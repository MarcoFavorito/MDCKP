# MDCKP
Multiple Disjunctively Constrained Knapsak problem: definition and an approximation algorithm implementation.

The problem is formally explained in [this document](https://github.com/MarcoFavorito/MDCKP/blob/master/docs/main.pdf).
In this repo you can find also an implementation in C++ of a naive algorithm for a simple solution.

## How to use

- Build the software:
```
make
```

- Run the algorithm:
```
bin/test_main < input_file
```

## Examples
```
bin/test_main < data/input_test_1
```
